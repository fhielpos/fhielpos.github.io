title: "Volunteering and sharing"
---

Last year I had the chance to be a volunteer in my [University's Programming and Problem Solving Tournament for High Schools](https://faiweb.uncoma.edu.ar/index.php/1291-resumen-programate-19). I have never been the best in math and programming, but I have always loved to solve problems so if there was something I wanted to do was to empower the younger versions of me.

When I was in high school there weren't as much resources as there are now - we barely had a desktop computer in my house and I didn't have internet in my phone -. Now, being 26 years old, every conference or meetup I attend leaves me with hunger to learn more things, or just simply motivates me. I wanted to transmit this kids the same thing I love to feel in every event, specially because there were kids that also didn't have the resources.

The event was great and was one of my best experiences so far, sharing metodologies or doing a colective problem solving process and then watching them achieve the result was a real joy. We have a lot of potential, we just have to empower it somehow.

Unfurtunatly this year it had to be a virtual event and I couldn't attend because of my job, but I wish I could be part of it next year.

If you know something, don't keep it to yourself, share it with others, it's awesome. Trust me.
