title: "Failing my CKA 1st attempt"
---

So, as the title says, I failed my 1st attempt at the CKA exam.

My result was 64, when I needed 66 to pass. Did it affect me? Not actually.

My last certification exam was on 2018, when I took some MCSA Exams, so I didn't know what to expect this time. I was nervous, like a lot, and I hurried the exam a bit. Some of the mistakes I made were the following (not relating to questions):

* I did not take the proper time to set aliases as well as vim settings at the start.
* Lost time re-reading questions when I should have moved forward through all the questions before.
* FOR SURE, worked on the `wrong cluster` at least one time.
* Did not use Kubernetes’ documentation enough.
* Did not read properly some questions.

So, I knew most of the questions answer, I just was a bit scared and a bit nervous (because this was a HUGE investment for me). What would I recommend you?

* Take your time before you start reading and set up vim and aliases as well as auto completion.
* Read the questions thoroughly, and if you get stuck, just flag it and move on.
* Use the docs! as well as the `kubectl explain` command. 
* Make sure you change clusters in every question, or use `tmux`
* Don’t be scared and breath.

Time management is one of the most important skills you need for this exam. You don't need to memorize YAML templates or anything like that, if you know the basics about Kubernetes and how it works, you will find your way through the exam.

So, if you are taking the CKA anytime soon, don't make the mistakes I made. Or if it helps you, make them anyway. I am confident enough to do my retake in the following days, so I will keep you posted!
