title: "Thoughts on Apple not including a charger anymore"
---

Apple announced a new iPhone and `won't include a charger and headphones on the box`. Why is people so mad about it?

First wrong statement I have seen a lot: "They are taking from us something that is suposed to be free". Nothing is free, specially when you're paying for it in the first place. The cost of the charger and headphones are included in the price of the iPhone, which by the way, is higher this year. So, if charger and headphones were included, the iPhone would be even more expensive.

The seconnd thing is that Apple claims that they have gone this way because of their `environment commitment`. This has a huge impact in a company like Apple:
With no charger the box is almost half the size, this leads to: less material and almost double the iPhones in a same shipping, so less fuel too. Also, I don't know about you, but my chargers last a long time, and Apple's 10w chargers didn't seem very high quality to be honest. So, if you don't really need a new charger, you won't get one, and that is less electronic waste, which might not be a big deal now, but from here to, lets say, 2030, it will. Take in count that when Apple makes a decision, is a long term one.
`If Apple sells 200M iPhones and only 60% of that people get a new charger, there will be 80M less chargers on the trash`.

I don't know, `I don't even own an iPhone`, but I think that it was a move in the right direction. And get used to it, because now other companies will follow Apple in the exact same direction.

PS: According to Word, this post has zero grammar mistakes, which would be the first one on the first try.
