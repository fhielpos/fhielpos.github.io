*Today, mistakes were made.*

So, [I have another blog where I write technical content in Spanish](https://culpeo.blog), which is hosted with Github Pages too. Today I was so frustrated with some work stuff and dealing with a networking problem within my Kubernetes lab that I wasn't thinking clearly.

In some point, for some reason, I switched between my github accounts and went to delete a repo (the blogs' one) that I have forked in my personal account. And I did, I wrote the name of the repo (`culpeoit/culpeoit.github.io`) to confirm that I wanted to delete it and then just deleted it. Three seconds later I realised of my mistake.

There wasn't a big deal, I recreated the repo and re-uploaded the content from my local copy. But this could have been way worst than it was. Sometimes we don't realise about things. We don't realise that we need to take breakes, that we need balance in our lifes.

This was a mini-bornout. This was a warning. This was not a test.
